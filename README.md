# Simple Markdown Viewer Demo

A demo from [my work](https://codepen.io/natsunoyoru/pen/jKxBxV) created 3 years ago.

## Get Started
```
cd simple-markdown-viewer
npm start
```

## TODOs
- Reconstruct the code, and delete redundant code
- Support more markdown flavor(and more preview support?)
- Make the page responsive
